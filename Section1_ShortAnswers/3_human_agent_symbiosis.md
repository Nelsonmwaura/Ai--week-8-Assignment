Human-Agent Symbiosis and its significance for the future of work.

Human-agent symbiosis pairs agents' speed and pattern recognition with human judgment and ethics. Agents handle repetitive tasks and real-time data, while humans supervise, resolve exceptions, and make value-based decisions. Unlike traditional automation that fully replaces a task, symbiosis emphasizes ongoing collaboration, learning loops, and shared responsibility. This leads to role shifts toward oversight, interpretation, and complex problem solving for humans, improving productivity while maintaining accountability.
