Technical challenges of memory and state management in AI Agents.

Challenges include determining what to store, bounding memory growth, ensuring fast semantic retrieval, privacy of stored state, and synchronizing state across distributed agents. Poor memory design leads to wrong or inconsistent decisions. Solutions: short-term working memory, compressed long-term stores, vector DBs for retrieval, and retention/expiry policies.
