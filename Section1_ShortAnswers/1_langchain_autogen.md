Compare and contrast LangChain and AutoGen frameworks.

LangChain composes modular components (prompt templates, chains, memory, tool connectors) to build structured LLM applications. It excels at retrieval-augmented generation, prompt engineering, and integrating external tools. AutoGen focuses on multi-agent coordination where multiple LLM-based agents interact, delegate tasks, and collaborate programmatically. LangChain is ideal for predictable pipelines and production integrations; AutoGen suits complex tasks that benefit from role-based agent cooperation. LangChain has a mature ecosystem for connectors and memory patterns; AutoGen is newer and centers on agent dialogue patterns, which can be harder to control. Choose LangChain for robust tool integrations and stateful assistants; choose AutoGen when task decomposition among cooperating agents is primary.
