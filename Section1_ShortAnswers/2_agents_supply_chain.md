How AI Agents are transforming supply chain management.

AI Agents automate monitoring and decision loops: predictive maintenance agents watch sensor data and schedule repairs; inventory agents forecast demand and place replenishment orders; routing agents replan deliveries in real time. Example: a predictive maintenance agent reduces unplanned downtime by scheduling maintenance before failure, saving lost-production costs. Dynamic routing agents reduce fuel and delivery times by adapting to traffic and weather. Business impacts include lower inventory holding costs, reduced downtime, faster deliveries, and improved customer satisfaction.
